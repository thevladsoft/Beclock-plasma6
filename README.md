This is a (hacky) fork of Plasma's digital clock, so that it shows rings like the old BeClock kwin effect (https://store.kde.org/content/show.php/BeClock?content=117542).
It has been rebased on the code of Plasma 6's digital clock (https://github.com/KDE/plasma-workspace/tree/master/applets/digital-clock), so some options are still not ported. The Plasma 5 version is in https://store.kde.org/p/1228863.
